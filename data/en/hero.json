  "description": "I'm Full-Stack Developer, who loves programming. I'm passionate about learning and improvement, always striving to make better and more optimal code. Ocasionally I play with design, but (at least for now) only for my personal projects. My \"most-loved\" framework is NextJs, but lately SvelteKit grabbed my attention. Currently working for The Software House, creating business and management apps.",
