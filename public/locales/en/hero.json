  "description": "I am a Frontend Developer who loves programming. I am passionate about creating applications, which is why I constantly strive to deepen my knowledge in the industry. I'm not afraid to work with backend, and occasionally I also dabble in design, although in both cases, I limit myself to personal projects. Professionally, I develop applications using React/NextJS, but my favorite framework is SvelteKit, in which I currently write most of my side projects. I am currently working for The Software House, where I create business applications and management tools.",
